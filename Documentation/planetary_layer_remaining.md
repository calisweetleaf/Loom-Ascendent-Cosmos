Planetary Layer Development Tasks

Core Planet Generator

[ ] Finalize geometry resolution & scaling constants

[ ] Implement high-precision rotation/tilt modeling

[ ] Optimize spherical coordinate mapping to grid

---

Atmospheric & Climate Engine

[ ] Expand atmospheric gas composition

[ ] Add wind vector fields (turbulence, jetstreams)

[ ] Skybox simulation: auroras, eclipses, cloud height

---

Terrain Subsystem

[ ] Terrain memory optimization with noise caching

[ ] Vegetation lifecycle & biome transitions

[ ] Geomagnetic layer stub for future compass behavior

---

Resource Simulation

[ ] Add rare resource classes (symbolic/meta/recursion-based)

[ ] Create decay/regrowth algorithms for organic resources

[ ] Integrate with symbolic engine (tie resource to emotion field)

---

Entity Systems

[ ] Write lifecycle methods for all EntityType classes

[ ] Expand EntityBiosphere to include recursive evolution traits

[ ] Add persistent memory state with ARFS4D interface

---

Temporal Layer

[ ] Add temporal anomalies + dilation zones

[ ] Create new calendrical system tied to grid logic

[ ] Develop custom epoch markers for symbolic cosmology

---

Quantum Feedback Engine

[ ] Increase entanglement resolution in environmental bridge

[ ] Allow reactive fluctuations to global emotional field

[ ] Hook into Loom Grid for trans-dimensional bleedover

---

Hooks and Extensions

[ ] Define trigger hooks for on_emotion_surge, on_symbolic_injection

[ ] Register overlay bridge endpoints for Loom Grid interactions

[ ] Connect RenderSupport to live diagnostics + entity overlays
