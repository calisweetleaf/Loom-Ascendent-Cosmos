# Loom Ascendent Cosmos — Master TODO (Initial Draft)

This initial TODO is derived from scanning the core Python modules (engines, quantum, perception, paradox, timeline, universe, reality kernel, cosmic scroll, Orama agent, mind seed, and related dataclasses). It precedes alignment with the Documentation folder (Genesis / Planetary / Project Structure / Technical README). A second pass will refine and expand after reviewing docs.

---

## 0. Critical Blocking Issues (Must-Fix First)

- [ ] Remove placeholder syntax (`;;;`, repeated empty class bodies, duplicated enum/class declarations) across: `mind_seed.py`, `paradox_engine.py`, `cosmic_scroll.py`, `quantum&physics.py`, `timeline_engine.py`, `universe_engine.py`, `orama_agent.py`, `perception_module.py`, `reality_kernel.py`, `reality_kernel_dataclasses.py`, `quantum_physics.py`, `quantum_bridge.py`.
- [ ] Eliminate duplicate class/enums (e.g., multiple `BreathPhase`, `Motif`, `Entity`, `Event` declarations in `cosmic_scroll.py`).
- [ ] Resolve shadow / conflicting SimulationConfig definitions (`universe_engine.py`, `quantum&physics.py`). Consolidate into single canonical dataclass.
- [ ] Add all missing imports (e.g., `logging`, `time`, `uuid`, `numpy as np`) where used implicitly (`reality_kernel_dataclasses.py`, others).
- [ ] Replace incomplete methods with minimal, meaningful implementations or raise explicit `NotImplementedError` with docstrings (prefer real implementation where feasible to meet “no stubs” standard).
- [ ] Fix malformed indentation / stray text inside methods (`aether_engine.py` trailing serialization block accidentally nested in method comment?).
- [ ] Standardize logging initialization (avoid multiple root `basicConfig` calls). Provide a central `logging_config.py`.
- [ ] Ensure every module defines a clear `__all__` for exported symbols.

## 1. Architecture & Module Cohesion

- [ ] Define authoritative module responsibility map (RealityKernel orchestration layers: Aether + Timeline + Quantum + Paradox + Perception + Harmonics + Persistence + Ethics).
- [ ] Replace cross-module circular imports with service interfaces or delayed injection factories.
- [ ] Introduce `interfaces/` package for Protocol / ABC definitions (e.g., `TemporalEngineInterface`, `QuantumFieldInterface`).
- [ ] Create unified configuration loader (YAML/JSON) with schema validation (pydantic or manual) feeding all engines.

# Loom Ascendent Cosmos — Master TODO (Aligned with Documentation Pass 1)

Initial draft built from code scan has been revised using architectural intent from: `Genesis_Framework.md`, `Planetary_Framework.md`, `Project_Structure.md`, and `Technical_README.md`.

Legend: [C] = Critical, [H] = High, [M] = Medium, [L] = Low priority.

## 0. Critical Blocking Issues (Must-Fix First)

- [C] Remove placeholder syntax (`;;;`, duplicate empty enums, repeated class shells) across: `mind_seed.py`, `cosmic_scroll.py`, `quantum&physics.py`, `timeline_engine.py`, `universe_engine.py`, `orama_agent.py`, `perception_module.py`, `reality_kernel.py`, `reality_kernel_dataclasses.py`, `quantum_physics.py`, `quantum_bridge.py` (NOTE: `paradox_engine.py` now largely implemented; shift focus to refining detection completeness and performance, not placeholder removal).
- [C] Consolidate `PhysicsConstants` + `SimulationConfig` into single authoritative module (`physics/constants.py`) and update imports.
- [C] Add missing imports: `logging`, `uuid`, `time`, `numpy as np`, `dataclasses`, etc. where referenced implicitly.
- [C] Fix malformed block in `aether_engine.py` (stray serialization dictionary inside interaction method comment scope) and ensure method boundaries are correct.
- [C] Replace all empty methods with real minimal implementations (no `pass` or undefined bodies) or justified `NotImplementedError` plus docstring.
- [C] Unify `BreathPhase` enum across Timeline, Quantum Bridge, Perception, and Orchestration layers (single definition; re-export where needed).
- [C] Decide fate of `quantum&physics.py` vs `quantum_physics.py` (merge or deprecate). Recommend: migrate any unique content then delete ampersand file (filesystem portability + clarity).
- [C] Normalize logging (single `logging_config.py`; remove multiple `basicConfig` calls) and configure rotating handlers referenced in docs.
- [C] Ensure integrity hash update script exists (pre-commit hook to recompute SHA-256 for banner fields) OR remove stale hashes until automation ready.

- Redundant `Motif`, `Entity`, `Event` scaffolds (`cosmic_scroll.py`).
- Two quantum module files (`quantum_physics.py` vs `quantum&physics.py`).
- (Resolved) Placeholder enums in `paradox_engine.py`—file now contains implemented enums and classes; follow-up tasks: performance tuning, divergence/oscillation/fixation/resonance detector implementations, richer contradiction semantics.

This TODO will evolve as subsystems are implemented. Keep deltas minimal and cross-reference Genesis documentation sections when closing items.
