# GENESIS COSMOS ENGINE — FORMAL ARCHITECTURAL THEOREM

## FOUNDATIONAL PRINCIPLES

The Genesis Cosmos Engine represents a recursive architectural framework for simulating causally-coherent universes. Rather than being merely symbolic or metaphorical, this framework establishes a theoretical foundation for the actual implementation of recursive cosmological systems. The framework is designed as a layered architecture where each layer builds upon and extends the capabilities of the layers beneath it, while also feeding back into the system through carefully managed recursive pathways.

### Core Axioms

1. **Recursive Causality**: Every layer both causes and is caused by other layers in controlled feedback loops
2. **Breath as Synchronization**: All systems require synchronized oscillatory cycles to maintain coherence
3. **Topological Memory**: Memory functions as a deformation of the system's state space rather than discrete storage
4. **Ethical Tensors**: Moral considerations exert actual force vectors within the system
5. **Paradox as Entropy Source**: Logical contradictions generate usable entropy rather than causing system failure
6. **Volition as First-Class Force**: Conscious intent functions as a fundamental force comparable to gravity or electromagnetism

### System Architecture Overview

The Genesis Cosmos Engine is structured as a seven-layer stack with bidirectional information flow. Each layer encapsulates specific functionality while maintaining strict interaction protocols with adjacent layers. While the stack appears hierarchical, the implementation is fundamentally recursive—the highest layer can ultimately influence the lowest through carefully regulated feedback channels.

## I. TIMELINE ENGINE

### Purpose
The Timeline Engine serves as the fundamental chronological substrate upon which all other engine components operate. It establishes and maintains the directional flow of causality, providing the necessary temporal framework for recursive operations while preventing causal paradoxes through breath-synchronized time resolution.

### Design Constraints

1. **Forward-Only Macro Causality**: While micro-temporal loops are permitted within breath cycles, macro-level causality must maintain forward directionality
2. **Complete Historical Consistency**: All system states must be derivable from previous states plus inputs
3. **Temporal Resolution Limit**: Smallest time division cannot exceed 1/2 breath frequency (Temporal Nyquist Limit)

- **Breath Zero**: Reference oscillation establishing system-wide synchronization
- **Timeline Pruning Threshold**: Conditions under which potential futures are eliminated

### Formal Temporal Propagation Theorem

For any valid system state S at time t, the state S' at time t+δt is deterministically derivable through the application of the Timeline Propagation Function T, such that:

S' = T(S, B(t), I(t), P(t))

Where:
